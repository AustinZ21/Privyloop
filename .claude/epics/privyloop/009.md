## Description

Implement platform-specific scraping modules for Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn with secure extension-backend communication. This task focuses on the actual data extraction logic and communication protocols between the browser extension and backend services.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Platform-specific scraping modules for Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn privacy pages
- [ ] Secure bidirectional communication between browser extension and backend API
- [ ] Automatic detection and navigation to privacy policy pages on supported platforms
- [ ] Robust data extraction with error handling and retry mechanisms

## Technical Details

### Platform Scraping Modules
- Google: Privacy settings, account activity, data downloads
- Facebook: Privacy settings, ad preferences, data processing
- LinkedIn: Privacy settings, data usage, communication preferences
- Modular architecture allowing easy addition of new platforms

### Extension-Backend Communication
- Secure API endpoints for data transmission
- Authentication tokens for user session management
- Real-time status updates during scraping operations
- Error reporting and diagnostic information

### Privacy Page Detection
- URL pattern matching for privacy-related pages
- DOM element identification for privacy controls
- Dynamic content loading detection and handling
- Platform-specific navigation and interaction logic

### Data Extraction Logic
- Privacy setting state capture and comparison
- Policy text extraction with change detection
- Metadata collection (timestamps, version info)
- Data validation and sanitization before transmission

## Dependencies

- **Task 004**: Platform registry and scraping engine architecture
- **Task 007**: Browser extension security architecture

## Effort Estimate

**Large** (3-4 days)

- Google platform integration: 1 day
- Facebook platform integration: 1.5 days
- LinkedIn platform integration: 1 day
- Extension-backend communication: 0.5 day

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All three platforms successfully scraped with 95%+ success rate
- [ ] Extension communicates securely with backend without data leakage
- [ ] Privacy pages automatically detected on platform navigation
- [ ] Data extraction handles dynamic content and JavaScript-rendered pages
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages platform changes and failures
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end data flow from extension to database
