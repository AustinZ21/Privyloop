# Task 003 - Authentication & User Management

## Description

Implement comprehensive user authentication and management system using Better Auth, supporting email/password registration with verification, session management, and user profile functionality. Design for both self-hosted and cloud deployment scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Better Auth integration with email/password and social providers
- [ ] Email verification system with transactional email support
- [ ] User registration flow with proper validation and error handling
- [ ] Session management with secure token handling and refresh logic

## Technical Details

### Authentication Setup
- Better Auth configuration for multiple deployment modes
- Email/password authentication with secure password hashing
- Social auth providers (Google, GitHub) for cloud deployment
- JWT token management with refresh token rotation

### Email System
- Transactional email service integration (Resend for cloud, SMTP for self-hosted)
- Email verification templates and logic
- Password reset functionality
- User notification preferences

### User Management
- Registration flow with input validation
- User profile management (email, password, preferences)
- Account settings and subscription tier tracking
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### Security Features
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- CSRF protection and secure session cookies
- Password strength requirements and validation
- Account lockout after failed attempts

## Dependencies

- **Task 001**: Requires monorepo structure and feature flag system
- **Task 002**: Requires user database schema and models
- Email service configuration (Resend API key or SMTP settings)

## Effort Estimate

**Medium (2-3 days)**
- Day 1: Better Auth setup, basic email/password authentication
- Day 2: Email verification system and user registration flow
- Day 3: Session management, security hardening, and testing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete authentication system with email verification working
- [ ] User registration and login flows tested in both deployment modes
- [ ] Session management with proper token lifecycle
- [ ] Security measures implemented (rate limiting, CSRF protection)
- [ ] User management API endpoints with proper error handling
