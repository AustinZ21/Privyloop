## Description

Implement secure Manifest V3 browser extension with progressive permissions, dynamic platform registry, and end-to-end encrypted communication. The extension serves as the primary interface for privacy data collection from social media platforms.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Manifest V3 extension with proper CSP policies and security headers
- [ ] Progressive permission system that requests minimal initial permissions and dynamically requests additional permissions as needed
- [ ] Dynamic platform registry that can be updated without extension updates
- [ ] End-to-end encrypted communication channel between extension and backend API

## Technical Details

### Manifest V3 Structure
- Service worker-based background script for persistent monitoring
- Content scripts for platform-specific data extraction
- Popup interface for user controls and status display
- Options page for configuration and settings

### Security Implementation
- Content Security Policy (CSP) with strict directives
- Secure message passing between content scripts and background
- Platform URL pattern matching with dynamic updates
- Encrypted storage for sensitive configuration data

### Permission Management
- Initial minimal permissions (activeTab, storage)
- Dynamic permission requests for specific platforms
- User consent flow for additional permissions
- Permission revocation and cleanup mechanisms

### Platform Registry
- Remote configuration for supported platforms
- Version control for platform definitions
- Fallback to local registry if remote unavailable
- Automatic updates with user notification

## Dependencies

- **Task 001**: Project structure and configuration
- **Task 004**: Platform registry and scraping engine architecture

## Effort Estimate

**Large** (3-4 days)

- Manifest V3 setup and security configuration: 1 day
- Permission management system: 1 day  
- Encrypted communication layer: 1 day
- Platform registry integration: 1 day

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Extension successfully installs with minimal permissions
- [ ] Dynamic permission requests work for all supported platforms
- [ ] Encrypted communication established with backend
- [ ] Platform registry updates without requiring extension reload
- [ ] All security tests pass including CSP validation
- [ ] Extension passes Chrome Web Store review guidelines
