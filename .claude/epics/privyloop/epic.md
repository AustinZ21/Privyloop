# Epic: PrivyLoop - Privacy Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
Implementation of PrivyLoop, an open source privacy monitoring platform with dual deployment models (self-hosted + cloud service). The system automates privacy settings analysis across major platforms using browser extension scraping, AI-powered explanations, and a comprehensive dashboard for change tracking.

## Architecture Decisions

### **Monorepo Structure**
- **Single repository** with Business Source License for dual deployment model
- **Feature flagging system** to enable/disable cloud vs self-hosted features
- **Package-based organization**: core, enterprise, web, extension, shared

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with shadCN/ui components and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (self-hosted) vs Supabase (cloud)
- **AI Processing**: Google Gemini API for privacy analysis
- **Browser Extension**: Manifest V3 with secure, scalable architecture

### **Deployment Strategy**
- **Self-hosted**: Docker Compose with minimal dependencies (PostgreSQL only)
- **Cloud service**: Vercel + Supabase + managed services
- **Pricing model**: Free (3 cards) → Pro ($4.99/mo) → Premium ($7.8/mo with AI agent)

## Technical Approach

### **Frontend Components**
- **Privacy Dashboard**: Corporate privacy cards with real-time status
- **Platform Connection Flow**: Progressive permission requests for browser extension
- **Change Visualization**: Diff views for privacy setting modifications
- **Subscription Management**: Stripe integration for cloud service tiers
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with accessibility compliance

### **Backend Services**
- **Privacy Scraping Engine**: Template-based storage with 95% size reduction
- **AI Analysis Service**: Gemini integration for plain-English explanations
- **Change Detection**: Versioned snapshots with diff algorithms
- **User Management**: Better Auth with email verification
- **Subscription API**: Stripe webhook handling and tier management

### **Browser Extension**
- **Security-First Architecture**: End-to-end encryption, CSP policies
- **Dynamic Platform Registry**: Server-managed platform configurations
- **Progressive Permissions**: Platform-by-platform access requests
- **Scalable URL Patterns**: Pattern-based matching vs hardcoded URLs

### **Infrastructure**
- **Self-hosted**: Single Docker Compose with PostgreSQL + app
- **Cloud**: Vercel + Supabase + Cloudflare R2 + Upstash Redis
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging with Pino
- **Security**: Data encryption, audit trails, compliance preparation

## Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: MVP (Months 1-6)**
1. Core monorepo structure and feature flagging
2. Basic dashboard with 3-platform support (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn)
3. Browser extension with security architecture
4. Self-hosted Docker deployment
5. Cloud service with Free/Pro tiers

### **Phase 2: Scale & AI Agent (Months 7-12)**
1. Premium tier with LangGraph + Inngest AI agent
2. Advanced analytics and reporting
3. Additional platform support (5+ platforms)
4. Enterprise features and compliance

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Platform Changes**: Firecrawl API fallback + rapid deployment pipeline
- **Extension Approval**: Comprehensive documentation and security audit
- **Legal Compliance**: Platform ToS analysis and privacy-by-design approach
- **User Adoption**: Progressive permission UX and clear value demonstration

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories for implementation:

- [ ] **Project Setup & Architecture**: Monorepo structure, feature flags, Docker configs
- [ ] **Core Backend Services**: Database schemas, privacy scraping engine, AI integration
- [ ] **Privacy Dashboard Frontend**: React components, state management, responsive design
- [ ] **Browser Extension**: Manifest V3 extension with security architecture
- [ ] **Authentication & User Management**: Better Auth integration, email verification
- [ ] **Payment & Subscription System**: Stripe integration, tier management
- [ ] **Platform Integration**: Google, Facebook, LinkedIn privacy scraping
- [ ] **Change Detection & Analytics**: Diff engine, historical data, basic reporting
- [ ] **Deployment & Infrastructure**: Docker setup, cloud deployment, monitoring
- [ ] **Testing & Quality Assurance**: E2E testing, security audit, performance optimization

## Dependencies

### **External Service Dependencies**
- **Google Gemini API**: AI analysis and recommendations
- **Firecrawl API**: Fallback web scraping service
- **Stripe API**: Payment processing (cloud service only)
- **Resend API**: Email service (cloud service only)

### **Platform Dependencies**
- **Browser Extension Stores**: Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons approval
- **Privacy Page Stability**: Google, Facebook, LinkedIn privacy interface consistency
- **API Rate Limits**: Gemini API quotas and cost management

### **Development Dependencies**
- **Domain Expertise**: Privacy law understanding, platform ToS analysis
- **Security Review**: Extension security audit before store submission
- **Legal Review**: Business Source License compliance and platform scraping legality

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### **Performance Benchmarks**
- **Dashboard Load Time**: <2s on 3G networks
- **Extension Response**: <500ms for privacy page scanning
- **Database Queries**: <200ms for dashboard data retrieval
- **API Response**: <1s for AI analysis generation

### **Quality Gates**
- **Test Coverage**: >80% unit test coverage, >70% integration coverage
- **Security Scan**: No high/critical vulnerabilities in security audit
- **Extension Approval**: Successful submission to Chrome Web Store and Firefox
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification

### **Business Metrics**
- **Self-hosted Adoption**: 100+ GitHub stars, 50+ Docker pulls within 3 months
- **Cloud Service Growth**: 1,000+ registered users, 60% 30-day retention
- **Platform Coverage**: 3+ major platforms with 95%+ accuracy in MVP

## Estimated Effort

### **Overall Timeline**
- **MVP Development**: 6 months (extended from original 4-month estimate)
- **Team Size**: 2-3 developers (full-stack + security focus)
- **Total Effort**: ~2,400-3,600 developer hours

### **Resource Requirements**
- **Development**: Lead full-stack developer + browser extension specialist
- **Design**: UI/UX designer for dashboard and extension interfaces
- **Legal/Compliance**: Privacy law consultation and platform ToS analysis
- **Security**: Security audit and penetration testing services

### **Critical Path Items**
1. **Browser Extension Security Architecture** (Month 1-2): Blocks platform integration
2. **Privacy Scraping Engine** (Month 2-3): Core functionality dependency
3. **Extension Store Approval** (Month 4-5): Required for user distribution
4. **AI Integration & Analysis** (Month 3-4): Key differentiator feature
5. **Production Deployment** (Month 5-6): Infrastructure and monitoring setup

**Risk Buffer**: 25% additional time allocated for platform changes, extension approval delays, and integration challenges.
