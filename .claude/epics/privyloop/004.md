# Task 004 - Privacy Scraping Engine & Template System

## Description

Build the core privacy scraping engine with template-based storage system for PrivyLoop. Implement platform-specific scraping logic, template system for 95% storage reduction, server-side platform registry, and browser extension integration. Focus on efficient data extraction and storage optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core scraping engine with platform-specific extraction logic
- [ ] Template-based storage system achieving 95% size reduction
- [ ] Server-side platform registry with platform configurations
- [ ] Browser extension integration with secure data transmission

## Technical Details

### Scraping Engine Architecture
- Platform-specific scraping modules (Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.)
- DOM parsing and privacy setting extraction
- Template matching and data normalization
- Error handling and retry logic for failed scrapes

### Template System Design
```typescript
// Template structure for storage optimization
interface PrivacyTemplate {
  platform_id: string;
  version: string;
  schema: TemplateSchema;
  compression_mappings: Record<string, string>;
}

// Compressed storage format
interface CompressedSnapshot {
  template_version: string;
  diff_data: CompressedDiff;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### Platform Registry System
- Server-side platform configurations and scraping rules
- Template versioning and migration system
- Platform-specific validation rules
- API endpoints for extension to fetch platform configurations

### Browser Extension Integration
- Secure communication between extension and backend
- Content script injection for privacy setting detection
- Background script for scheduled scraping
- Data transmission with compression and encryption

## Dependencies

- **Task 001**: Requires monorepo structure and packages/extension setup
- **Task 002**: Requires database schema for platforms and privacy_snapshots tables
- Browser extension development environment and testing tools

## Effort Estimate

**Large (3-4 days)**
- Day 1: Core scraping engine architecture and platform registry
- Day 2: Template system implementation and storage optimization
- Day 3: Browser extension integration and data transmission
- Day 4: Testing, error handling, and performance optimization

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Scraping engine successfully extracts privacy settings from major platforms
- [ ] Template system achieves 95% storage reduction through compression
- [ ] Platform registry serves configurations to browser extension
- [ ] Browser extension communicates securely with backend API
- [ ] Comprehensive testing with multiple platforms and edge cases
