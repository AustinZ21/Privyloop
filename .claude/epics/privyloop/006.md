# Task 006 - Change Detection & Diff Engine

## Description

Implement intelligent change detection system with versioned snapshots and diff algorithms. Build notification engine that alerts users to privacy setting changes across platforms. Create efficient storage for historical data and meaningful change reporting with impact assessment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Snapshot versioning system with efficient diff comparison
- [ ] Change detection algorithms identifying meaningful privacy changes
- [ ] Notification system with configurable alerting preferences
- [ ] Historical change tracking with impact analysis and reporting

## Technical Details

### Snapshot Versioning System
```typescript
interface PrivacySnapshot {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  platform_id: string;
  version: number;
  settings_hash: string;
  compressed_data: CompressedSettings;
  created_at: Date;
}

interface ChangeDetection {
  detectChanges(previous: PrivacySnapshot, current: PrivacySnapshot): PrivacyDiff[];
  assessImpact(changes: PrivacyDiff[]): ImpactAssessment;
  generateNotifications(changes: PrivacyDiff[]): NotificationEvent[];
}
```

### Diff Algorithm Implementation
- Intelligent diff comparison beyond simple value changes
- Privacy-aware change classification (critical, important, minor)
- Template-based diff storage for space efficiency
- Change aggregation and deduplication logic

### Change Notification System
- User-configurable notification preferences (email, push, dashboard)
- Change severity classification and filtering
- Notification scheduling and rate limiting
- Rich notification content with context and recommendations

### Impact Analysis Engine
- Privacy impact scoring based on setting importance
- Historical trend analysis for privacy degradation detection
- Platform-specific impact weighting and context
- User privacy goal alignment assessment

## Dependencies

- **Task 002**: Requires database schema for privacy_snapshots and notifications
- **Task 004**: Requires scraping engine data as input for change detection
- Email service for change notifications (from Task 003 auth system)
- Background job processing system for scheduled change detection

## Effort Estimate

**Medium (2-3 days)**
- Day 1: Snapshot versioning and core diff algorithm implementation
- Day 2: Change detection logic and impact analysis engine
- Day 3: Notification system integration and historical reporting

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Change detection accurately identifies meaningful privacy setting changes
- [ ] Notification system delivers timely alerts based on user preferences
- [ ] Snapshot versioning efficiently stores historical data with minimal overhead
- [ ] Impact analysis provides actionable insights on privacy degradation
- [ ] Historical reporting shows privacy trends and platform behavior patterns
