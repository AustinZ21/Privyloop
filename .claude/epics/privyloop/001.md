# Task 001 - Project Setup & Monorepo Architecture

## Description

Establish the foundational monorepo architecture for PrivyLoop, supporting both self-hosted and cloud deployments. Set up package structure with shared core functionality and deployment-specific features, implement feature flag system for dual-deployment support, and configure development tooling.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Monorepo structure with packages/core, packages/enterprise, packages/web, packages/extension
- [ ] Feature flag system differentiating self-hosted vs cloud functionality
- [ ] Shared configuration and build tooling across packages
- [ ] Development environment with hot reload and package linking

## Technical Details

### Package Structure
```
packages/
├── core/           # Shared utilities, types, validation
├── enterprise/     # Cloud-specific features (billing, multi-tenant)
├── web/           # Next.js dashboard application
└── extension/     # Browser extension for privacy scraping
```

### Feature Flag System
- Environment-based feature detection (`DEPLOYMENT_MODE=self-hosted|cloud`)
- Runtime feature toggles for UI components
- Build-time code elimination for unused features

### Development Tooling
- Turborepo for monorepo management
- Shared ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript configurations
- Package interdependency management
- Hot module replacement across packages

## Dependencies

This is a foundation task with no dependencies. All subsequent tasks depend on this architecture.

## Effort Estimate

**Medium (2-3 days)**
- Day 1: Monorepo setup, package structure, basic configuration
- Day 2: Feature flag system implementation
- Day 3: Development tooling configuration and testing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All four packages created with proper package.json and basic structure
- [ ] Feature flag system implemented and tested
- [ ] Development environment runs successfully with package linking
- [ ] Build system configured for both deployment modes
- [ ] Documentation for architecture decisions and development setup
