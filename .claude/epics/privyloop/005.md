# Task 005 - AI Analysis & Gemini Integration

## Description

Integrate Google Gemini API for intelligent privacy analysis and plain-English explanations. Build AI-powered recommendation engine that analyzes privacy settings, identifies risks, and provides actionable insights. Implement efficient caching and template-based analysis for cost optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Google Gemini API client with rate limiting and error handling
- [ ] Privacy analysis pipeline generating plain-English explanations
- [ ] AI recommendations engine suggesting privacy improvements
- [ ] Template caching system for cost-effective API usage

## Technical Details

### Gemini API Integration
```typescript
interface GeminiClient {
  analyzePrivacySettings(settings: PrivacySnapshot): Promise<AnalysisResult>;
  generateExplanations(settings: PrivacySetting[]): Promise<Explanation[]>;
  suggestImprovements(analysis: AnalysisResult): Promise<Recommendation[]>;
}

interface AnalysisResult {
  risk_score: number;
  privacy_level: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  explanations: PlainEnglishExplanation[];
  recommendations: PrivacyRecommendation[];
}
```

### Analysis Pipeline
- Privacy setting risk assessment using AI models
- Plain-English explanation generation for technical settings
- Contextual recommendation engine based on user privacy goals
- Batch processing for multiple platform analysis

### Template Caching System
- Cache common analysis patterns to reduce API costs
- Template-based prompts for consistent AI responses
- Smart cache invalidation based on platform updates
- Cost tracking and usage optimization

### AI Recommendations Engine
- Personalized privacy recommendations based on user behavior
- Risk prioritization and impact assessment
- Actionable step-by-step improvement guides
- Integration with platform-specific privacy controls

## Dependencies

- **Task 002**: Requires database models for storing analysis results
- **Task 004**: Requires scraped privacy data for analysis input
- Google Gemini API access and configuration
- Analysis result storage schema in database

## Effort Estimate

**Medium (2-3 days)**
- Day 1: Gemini API client setup and basic privacy analysis
- Day 2: AI recommendations engine and explanation generation
- Day 3: Template caching system and cost optimization

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Gemini API successfully analyzes privacy settings with meaningful insights
- [ ] Plain-English explanations generated for complex privacy settings
- [ ] AI recommendations provide actionable privacy improvement steps
- [ ] Template caching system reduces API costs by 60%+ through smart reuse
- [ ] Analysis pipeline handles multiple platforms efficiently with error recovery
